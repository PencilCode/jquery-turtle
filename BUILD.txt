Short version
-------------
npm install
grunt


Long version
------------
jQuery-turtle's minifier and unit tests use "grunt", running under node.js.

So the basic steps to get a working environment are:

(1) Install node.js on your system (various routes to do this).
(2) Use npm to install the grunt command, e.g., sudo npm install -g grunt-cli
(3) Grab the source: git clone git://github.com/PenciCode/jquery-turtle.git
(4) cd jquery-turtle and pull in dependencies locally: npm install
(5) Now build (minify) and test: grunt


Dependencies
------------
The project includes snapshots of some dependencies.  To update these
dependencies, "grunt bowercopy".


Testing
-------

Unit tests use a headless webkit.  When setting it up on a system without
GUI, you may find that you need to install font support.  On debian.
"apt-get libfontconfig1" provides enough font support.
